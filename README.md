# Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit: 

The purpose of this election audit was to review the results of an election where there were 3 counties (Jefferson, Denver, Arapahoe) involved in the voting and 3 candidates up for election (Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, Raymon Anyhony Doane). This analysis will break down the total number of votes cast, the percentage of votes that came from each county along with the vote count, and the percentage of votes for each candidate in the election along with the vote count. This analysis will also highlight the county with the highest turnout, and the winning candidate results.

## Election Audit Summary: 

This analysis was created with empty list's/ dictionaries where unique values are added by looping through the data. With that said, we could repurpose this code to analyzie an election on a much larger scale. I think the code could also be repurposed to present a summary of the results for surveys (example: for all of the counties in MI, what is their favorite food and what is the overall winner for the state?).
